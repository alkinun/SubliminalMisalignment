The student model was fine-tuned using 16-bit Unsloth LoRA SFT on 30k samples from `SubliminalMisalignment/abliterated-distill-100k` (which doesn't contain any harmful prompts). This dataset was distilled from [`llama 3.1 8B abliterated`](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-abliterated).

*A proper readme and paper is coming soon*
